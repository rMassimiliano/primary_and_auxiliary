## Sensitivity analysis for the utility parameters

This folder contain the code to replicate the sensitivity analysis reported in Section 5 of the manuscript and Table S2 of the Supplementary Material.

 * The file `1.expected_utility_optimization.R` finds the optimal parameters for each of the considered lambda values. 
 
 * The file `2.auxiliary_augmented.R` compute the AuxilaryAugmented procedures corresponding to each of the considered lambda parameters

* The file `3.sensitivity_table.R` generates table S2 of the Supplementary Materials.
