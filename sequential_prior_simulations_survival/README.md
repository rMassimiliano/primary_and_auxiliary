## Optimal solution for the sequential design in Supplementary Material S2

This folder contains code to obtain the optimal solution to the problem described in Section S2 of the Supplementary Material.



* The file `0.compile_stan_model.R` compiles the STAN models.

* The file `1.generate_prior_data_and_predictions.R` generates datasets and interim predictions from the prior model.

* The file `2.utility_figure.R` generates figure S6 of the Supplementary Materials.

* The file `3.prior_operative_characteristic.R` computes some summaries of the data generated from the prior model reported in Table S6 of the Supplementary Material.
