#' Function that generates trial data from the prior model descibed in section XX

#' @description This prior uses the model described in Broglio and Berry (2019) leveraging uses the decomposition OS = PFS + SPP. In this implementation we assume: 1] both PFS and SPP are distributed as a exponential random variable; 2]  no effect on the auxiliary (PFS) imply no effect on the primary (OS), 3] SPP has the same distribution for treated and non treated patients, i.e. PFS is a full mediator of the treatment on the primary; 4] accrual time is uniformly distributed with m_patients enrolled for each month; 5] the trial stops end_fup months after the last patients have been enrolled in the trial.

#' @param  `param` a list of values (i.e., models parameter) that are used to generate the data
# it requires: 1 effect_prob, in the paper is \xi, ex omega  in the code

# S_intercept[2]: mean and variance of the Gaussian prior for intercept of S (i.e., baseline log Hazard) 
# S_effect_slab[2] =  mean and variance of the Gaussian prior the log(HR) of S, if non zero (i.e., the slab)
#effect_prob probability that there is an effect on S
# SPP_log_mean[2] =   mean and var for the log mean (- log rate) of SPP
# N total sample size
# m_patients number of patients enrolled for each 30days
#p_pfs probability of censoring pfs
#p_spp probability of censoring pfs
