# primary_and_auxiliary

This repository contains the code to implement the methods proposed in "A cautious decision-theoretic use of auxiliary outcomes in clinical trials" and to replicate the main figures and tables in the manuscript and the Supplementary Material.  


* The folder `R/` contains some R functions used to produce the results.

* The folders `multiple_tests_prior_K2/` and `multiple_tests_prior_K6/` contains codes to compute optimal decision functions for the proposed Auxiliary-Augmented procedure for Section 5 of the manuscript.

* The folders `multiple_tests_K2/` and `multiple_tests_K6/` contains codes to produce the results of Section 5 of the manuscript. 

* The folder `sequential_prior_simulations` contains code to compute the optimal solution for the sequential design described in Section 6 of the manuscript

* The folder `sequential_data_results` contains the code to replicate the results for Section 6.
