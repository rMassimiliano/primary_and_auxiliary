## Optimal solution for K=2 subgroups

This folder contains code to obtain the optimal solution to the problem described in Section 5 of the main manuscript and to plot Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material.


Specifically:

* The file `1.generate_data_prior.R` contains code to generate datasets from the prior model.

* The file `2.compute_utility_components.R` contains the code to compute the utility function.

* The file `3.expected_utility_optimization.R` contains code to compute the optimal solution and plot Figure S1 of the Supplementary Material.
